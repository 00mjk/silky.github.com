## Appendix: Background

I glance at _a lot_ of academic papers. This comes from a kind of obsession I
have of staying up-to-date with the current research, via
[SciRate](https://scirate.com/). I follow a few fields I'm particularly keen
on, but also other fields that I have no idea about, but often just have cool
pictures or thoughts that I like.

Aside from just glancing, I also occasionally try and actually read a paper;
at least to get a feel for what they're up to.

The papers around computer vision and machine learning tend to be "easy" to
consume at a glance for one reason: they have pictures! You don't even need to
read the content, really, to get a feeling for what they are up to. Sure, if
you want to implement anything, or use any of their techniques then it's going
to help to read it. But using this method, it's definitely possible to get a
useful working understanding of where the field is at. Indeed, this is
(roughly) what I did to prepare the [Braneshop
Showreel](https://braneshop.com.au/showreel.html).

(Infact, I had to do a bit
more work to produce these; insofaras I had to read a bit of the paper in
order to work out what it does and what is new, which is why the [backlog for the Showreel is so
large](https://github.com/BraneShop/showreel/issues/)).

But, what does one do if one wants to read one of the "harder" papers; those
without simple picture explanations of what they do?

Well, normally you undertake the gruelling task of actually _reading_ it.

#### How to read academic papers?

Isn't it crazy that there are
[articles](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)
out there explaining _how_ to read papers? Shouldn't it be easy? Why isn't it?

I remember when I was starting out, I had the same problem everyone has: the
papers are impossible to read. They are dense; each sentence is packed with
information and strong arguments; if you want to verify every sentence you
often need to do some math calculation, and it can feel totally
insurmountable!

Here's how I often feel the process of reading a paper goes: First, the
authors pack all their knowledge, experience, skill and detail into a few
sentences and equations. Then, later, the reader needs to have that same
(implicit) knowledge, and only then can they unpack the information.

It frustrated me a lot. Why did the authors spend so much time building these
dense sentences, and why was I spending so much time unpacking them?
Moreoever, wasn't it a waste? If I'm doing it, surely other people are as
well? Why not just ... not pack each sentence so densely, and then your work
immediately becomes more accessible?

In any case, I didn't do anything about it; I just got better at managing the
status quo.  As I got more experienced, I realised you can mostly skip all the
details (or, I started to gain more of the implicit knowledge necessary to
skip and still understand), and come back to the parts you don't
understand. I felt accomplished, if not a bit annoyed that I had to "half"
understand things; and it resulted in me feeling completely unsure of my
ability in my field.

Occasionally I would stumble across a nice, readable paper. For me,
