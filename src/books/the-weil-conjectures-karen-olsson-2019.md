### Thoughts 

I loved this book! It's written in a really interesting style, and it's nice
to see the authors personality and experience come through and be intermingled
with subjects; the Weil siblings


### Notes

- Page 99 has a list of cool math paper titles.
- Page 107 refers to [Hadamard's
Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1454428.The_Psychology_of_Invention_in_the_Mathematical_Field) and mentions that he loves mushrooms.
- Page 112: "... The matricies of my dream were life-size, with detachable
rows and columns that would hover over a person and act upon him or her in
some instructable way".
- Page 119 discusses writing down math proofs alongside the "thoughts that
appear in your head" as your thinking of the proofs. This is a fun idea, and
could be done in many contexts!
- Page 143: "... any transformation in any realm has a fixed point..."
- Page 144: Mentions Brouwer's book "[Life, Art, and
Mysticism](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1039886518)"
