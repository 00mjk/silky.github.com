Hi! I'm a programmer from Melbourne, Australia. I'm interested in maths,
physics, quantum computing, fashion, art, music, machine learning, dance,
and most things. I like to meet people and talk about stuff and in particular
do new and interesting things.

If you want to contact me you can send me an email at <a
    href="mailto:noonsilk@gmail.com">noonsilk@gmail.com</a>.
</p>

<p> Feel free to send me an email about stuff that I might like,
or just to say hello, or for whatever reason!</p>
