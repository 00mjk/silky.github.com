Following [Jay](http://jehosafet.com/), [On me, 14 March
2014](https://medium.com/p/21a78487a2b3), I have the following things on me.

Pockets
---

**Front right**: Brown wallet (ANZ cards, one not activated, ASP card, driver's
license, university card, $40 cash, a Myki, two hand-made business cards, one
receipt written in Arabi, two "You are not alllowed to pass until you decide
about your future" pieces of paper, Burstin and Partners business card, Biarri
business card, ANZ business card, Spudbar card with free potato waiting,
receipt for bike repairs, I.R.L. shooter business card, Electron
Workshop business card, driver's license renewal document, colour run
sticker, tiny tiny notebook for phone numbers with one number in it
(a hairdresser), Castro's coffee card, and about 5 "You are not
allowed to pass..." notes in a hidden compartment).

Because I am sitting at my desk, I don't have my keys or phone in my pocket,
so I exclude those from consideration.

**Front left**: Handkerchief.

**Back pockets**: Empty.

Backpack

**Front pocket**: Handerchieft, and a small rock.

**Second front pocket**: Assortment of Allen keys, portable box of personal
grooming things (nail clippers, etc), several paper "clamps"? $13.30 in coins
from Australia.

**Main pocket**: Several pieces of scrap paper, more paper clamps, a bottle
cap, "[Approximation Algorithms](http://amzn.com/3540653678)", a single
