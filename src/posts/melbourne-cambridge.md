So, I'm very excited to share that we're moving overseas! We're headed to
Cambridge in the UK at the end of this month.

I'm very lucky to be starting work with a very cool quantum computing company:
[Riverlane](https://www.riverlane.com/).


## Leaving Melbourne

It's going to be interesting leaving Melbourne. I've lived here all my life
basically, and I've found a really nice group of friends. I'm going to miss
everyone.

I owe a big thanks to **everyone** that's helped me in my career and life over the
years here. I won't list all of you, but thanks :) I wouldn't be where I am if
I hadn't had your help and support. ‚ù§Ô∏è üíñ 

In particular the meetup community has been a great place for me and somewhere
I was able to forge some really strong friendships. Specifically, I've had a
great time at the Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup, the Haskell Meetup, back
in the day I loved MXUG, and of course I have to thank my friend David Kemp
for being the only consistent attendee of the Quantum Lunch, started way back
in the day! I'll also miss hanging out with the cool people who've come to
events I've helped organise, such as [compose
conference](https://www.composeconference.org/2016-melbourne/) and
[post-prediction conference](https://postpredictionconference.github.io/). I
love Melbourne for the really nice connection you get between different
communities, and it's been some of my favourite times meeting people from
outside my standard little bubble.

I also have to thank my friend Charles Hill from Melbourne University, who
taught me so much about quantum computing, is an amazing researcher and
very kind and generous person.

Thanks also to the other people in the tech community here that have supported
me and helped me first move into new jobs and learn interesting and fun
things. I've been very lucky.

Of course, thanks again to all the people that helped out with
[Braneshop](https://braneshop.com.au/) whom I've already mentioned over there.


## Cambridge

We're totally new to Cambridge, so if you've got suggestions/connections I'd
love to hear about it! Definitely keen to meet some people and get into the
community over there.


**Reach out if you like!**

I've benefited a lot from emailing random people and just asking questions,
so please feel free to reach out to me if you think I can help with
anything!
