title: Ideas and actions for getting, and keeping, women in technology

In my job I'm almost entirely surrounded by men.

I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at
[Silverpond](http://silverpond.com.au). It's definitely the best place I've
ever worked, but there's one area that we're actively trying to improve:
recruiting women into roles as software engineers and machine learning
engineers.

In this post I'll cover some ideas I've had along these lines.


## The Recruiting Side

When I've been involved in recruiting people, in recent history, it's tended
to be almost entirely by word of mouth. My process is:

1. I find out there's a job available,
2. I think about the people I know who might be good,
3. I approach them.

This actually works very well, but only because I tend to go to a lot of
events, and I meet a lot of people. The one key problem with this approach is:
I mostly end up recommending men.

I think that the reason for this can be somewhat explain by various [cognitive
biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) (notably,
"[Ingroup bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism)"), and so
I've been thinking about how to address it.

I was pointed at the few articles along these lines, and I'll summarise them
here:

**[Avoiding the 'merit trap'](http://malechampionsofchange.com/take-practical-action/avoiding-the-merit-trap/)** - Chief Executive Women and Male Champions of Change

- **Summary**: "Merit-based" hiring is correlated with under-representation for
    diverse teams.
- Thoughts:
    - Be aware that any definition of "merit" is somewhat subjective and
        current-circumstances dependant.
    - Deciding which qualities are meritable isn't particularly easy.
    - This might mean that "puzzle"-based hiring; i.e. "complete this puzzle
      which when solved gives an email address that you can email for a job"
      is potentially not a good approach.
- Actions:
    - As much as you can, don't pre-suppose a list of skills and
        qualities, because your selection is biased to the intersection of
        skills that your current team has, or that you've seen before.
    - Allow the candidates to express their own individuality in the
        interviewing process.
    - Prefer the person that adds something new to the team.


**[Beginning with
Ourselves](http://nerds.airbnb.com/beginning-with-ourselves/)** - Airbnb

- **Summary**: Airbnb was didn't have many women in their data science team;
  they adjusted their interview process and grew the community, both of which
  had an impact.
- Thoughts:
    - Your interview process can be biased, and it's probably hard to figure
      out when that is. If someone tells you, take it seriously.
- Actions:
    - Build the community you want to see.
    - Make your interview process friendly and welcoming to all.
    - If possible, have a balance of male/female involvement in the interview.


**[How blind auditions help orchestras to eliminate gender bias](https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/14/blind-auditions-orchestras-gender-bias)** - The
Guardian, and **[How Companies Are Taking Unconscious Bias Out of the Hiring Equation](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/diversity/2017/how-companies-are-taking-unconscious-bias-out-of-the-hiring-equation)** -
LinkedIn Talent Blog

- **Summary**: If you want to not be biased towards a certain gender, then
  just keep the gender hidden until they're employed!
- Thoughts:
    - It's interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. It wouldn't help for
      internal promotions, say. But maybe it's a useful hack to bootstrap the
      process.
    - It's not practical for me at Silverpond.
- Actions:
    - When thinking about a candidate, and making some subjective assesment,
      think if you would make this same assesment if the gender of the
      candidate was unknown or switched.

**[Our experiences in elevating the representation of women in leadership](http://malechampionsofchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/31.-2011-MCC-report.pdf)** - Male Champions of Change

- **Summary**: Diversity in leadership can be achived by small concrete steps:
  getting the CEO interested, setting up metrics, building communities and
  support networks, and reporting on growth and successes achieved as a result
  of these actions.
- Thoughts:
    - This is a very "corporate" article, but contains some good points.
- Actions:
    - Convince or demonstrate to the people in charge of hiring that they
      should become very interested in diversifying the team; without this you
      will struggle.
    - Set up mechanisms to track progress numerically.
    - Set quantitive targets.
    - Build and support the community you want to see.

Concretely, what I'm going to do in this regard &mdash; getting more diverse
applicants into the top of our "hiring funnel" &mdash; is:

1. Network with a more diverse group; head to events I've not been to before,
1. Improve the messaging on our website around hiring, and write down some
   statistics that we can start tracking,
1. Build and support the community.
1. When thinking about a candidate, and making some subjective assesment,
   think if I would make this same assesment if the gender of the candidate
   was unknown or switched.
1. Donâ€™t pre-suppose an overly-specific list of skills and qualities.

and during the interview process, I think the following ideas are useful to
keep in mind:

1. Make sure everyone has an opportunity to feel comfortable,
1. Allow the candidates to express their own individuality,
1. Does this person add something new to the team?
1. Is the job a [cool opportunity](http://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/16/hiring---opportunity/) for this person?

This is kind of a Part-1 of my thoughts on this topic. I've had this post
sitting in _drafts_ for a while, so I thought I'd publish it.  I expressed
some related ideas in our
[blog](http://silverpond.com.au/2017/03/27/silverponds-diversity-report.html).
Let's see how it progresses over the next few months.

    - Encouragement
    - Internal/Exerternal actions
    - community building/support
    - differing interests? maybe don't expect pages of github repos
    - passion vs side projects ...
    - changing requirements on men too?
    - ?
