I've seen a few people post the books that they've read over the last year; so
I thought I'd also get in on the action.  Here are the books that I read (or
partially read) last year:

### Non-Fiction

<div class="book">

<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/oregon.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Oregon Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)**
by Christopher W. Alexander,  Murray Silverstein, Shlomo Angel, Sara Ishikawa, Denny Abrams
  
Anyone that knows me, knows that Christopher Alexander is basically my
personal Jesus. This book is amazing, to me in it's demonstration of
Alexander's (and collaborators) standard approach to architecture; i.e
building via small local activities in an endless cycle according to a
specific and developing pattern language. It also contains very important
insights, in my mind, in terms of project management and [budgeting](/posts/2018-11-09-quick-note-on-budgeting.html).

<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/educated.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Educated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated)**
by Tara Westover

I learned about this one from [Bill
Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Educated). It's amazing. I found it
really fascinating to read about Tara's life, and how she understood her
upbringing. It makes you think quite a lot about the things you tell yourself
to make sense of the situations you're in.
</div>
</div>

<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/darkemu.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Dark Emu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21401526-dark-emu)**
by Bruce Pascoe

Soon to be (if not already) an Australian classic; it's very interesting to
learn an entirely different history about our country and the Aboriginal
people. I found it to be reasonably hard reading because there are some solid
descriptions of various items and processes that it would've been amazing to
have pictures of. In any case, necessary reading.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/candor.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Radical Candor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939161-radical-candor)**
by Kim Malone Scott

I basically hated this book. I think, on the one hand, it _does_ have useful
information in it; but for me it came across too much like standard Silicon
Valley propoganda. I do think there is good stuff in here, for leaders that
struggle with feedback.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/citiesforpeople.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Cities for People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8556291-cities-for-people)**
by Jan Gehl

Recommended to me by Ryan, who was working as a Barista at from [Streat](https://www.streat.com.au/),
this book is, apparently, a classic of urban planning. It's amazing. It has a
incredibly readable style; with lots of pictures and summaries of each
paragraph. Jan has had a lot of impact in designing Melbourne, so it's really
interesting to read this book and see and understand the impact he and his
team have had.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/factfulness.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Factfulness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness)**
by Hans Rosling,  Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling RÃ¶nnlund

Quite good. From this book I learned about the website [Dollar
Street](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/), which is incredible and
well worth a visit. Hans has many questions in the book; almost all of which I
answered wrong, much like most of his audience that he's asked the questions
to. I learned a lot about how to think about world-wide progress, and that
there are interesting organisations out there doing interesting work. I also
learned, much to my surprise, that the World Bank isn't a bank in the sense
that I would've assumed; it's main goal is to end poverty!
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/enlightenment.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Enlightenment Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35696171-enlightenment-now)**
by Steven Pinker

Not bad. This is the first book of Steven Pinker I've read. I'm unlikely to
read more, after learning about some sexist views he's had from [Delusions of
Gender](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8031168-delusions-of-gender) (not a
book I've read yet; but heard thoughts from my partner).

I found this book to be reasonably good, and make some solid arguments for
continuing to fight against people that don't think progress is real.
Unfortunately, to paraphrase a joke from the Simposns, Steven seems like the
kind of person that can use graphs to prove anything that is even remotely
true. It contains too many anecdotes and cherry-picked examples. 

I'd recommend Factfulness over this one.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/trees.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Hidden Life of
Trees](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28256439-the-hidden-life-of-trees)**
by Peter Wohlleben

Really great. I've always been a bit of a hippie, and am mostly vegetarian, so when
my partner found out I'd be reading this one, she started to get a bit concerned that
I'd soon not even eat greens! Now, I haven't quite gone that far, but I do really love
the ideas and science in this book; and I think it's really interesting to think of
trees and their root-systems as being some giant entity. The one downside to this book
is that it occasionally lacks pictures of the concepts that are being described.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/surfaces.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Surfaces and Essences](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7711871-surfaces-and-essences)**
by Douglas R. Hofstadter, Emmanuel Sander

Amazing. Probably not for people feeling a bit impatient. The book goes into many
examples of the ideas; and makes a strong argument for the idea that all thinking
is based on analogies. I've always loved analogies, so I'm naturally a big fan.

As someone presently working in AI, I found this book full of many incredibly
interesting and relevant ideas; one of which we discussed
[previously](/posts/2018-06-16-when-will-google-translate-be-great.html).

If you're at all interested in when computers might be able to get 
to think like humans, definitely have a read!
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/buddhism.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Why Buddhism is True](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32895535-why-buddhism-is-true)**
by Robert Wright

Amazing. Recommended to me by my friend Julia. Probably one of the best books
I've ever read, really; right up there with Christopher Alexander's "[Nature of
Order](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3131171-the-nature-of-order)" and
"[The Timeless Way of
Building](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106728.The_Timeless_Way_of_Building)".
This book is particularly neat, of course, because it takes a scientific
approach to making sense of buddhist ideas. Overall, I find lots of agreement
between this book, and the ideas of Christopher Alexander, and Surfaces and
Essences.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/inferior.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Inferior](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31869108-inferior)**
by Angela Saini

Pretty interesting. In this book Angela debunks many myths about the supposed
biological differences between men and women. This is the first book of this
kind that I've read; it won't be the last.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/adam-smith.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821053-how-adam-smith-can-change-your-life)**
by Russ Roberts

I read this because my partners dad had it in the house. It's pretty good;
it's really interesting to see the thoughts from someone from so far back in
history. For me, this book resonated with the ideas I read in "Why Buddhism is
True". Worth reading if you happen upon it.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/siddartha.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Siddartha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11510916-siddartha)**
by Hermann Hesse

I was not a fan of this. Recommended to me by my partner; I found it to be way
too "on the nose" about enlightenment. I felt like I was being dragged around
to understand certain things, in an obliquely mystical way. Maybe it's because
I read it after I read Why Buddhism is True; which is much more direct and
scientific.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/last-lecture.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Last Lecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40611510-the-last-lecture)**
by Randy Pausch

Quite good; but quite "American". If you don't like too much american-style
dreams of success and culture, you might not like this. There's also the [video
of the talk that inspired it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo) that
is well worth watching.

I watched the video way back in the day; and thought I'd finally read the book.
I wasn't disappointed, but I'm not sure I got much new out of the book that I
didn't get out of the talk. Still, worth grabbing if you got something out of
the talk.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/big-picture.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Big Picture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26150770-the-big-picture)**
by Sean Carroll

Not great. Before I'd read this, I really had thought I liked Sean Carroll.
But, this book comes across to me as very arrogant. As someone who's read way
too many popular physics books, it contained a fair amount that wasn't new to
me (but that's okay), but also a fair amount of just plain arrogance about what
is known, where we can expect progress and what areas are accessible to
science.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/lost-connections.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Lost Connections](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections)**
by Johann Hari

I really enjoyed this. I've also suffered (mild, I think) depression, and can
really relate to the ideas in this book; namely making connections with people. Probably
not the solution for everyone, but interesting reading.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/made-by-humans.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Made by Humans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40626257-made-by-humans)**
by Ellen Broad

Not bad. Fairly introductory thoughts on the topic, but from someone working in
policy on this area. Nice to see an Australian view on these issues. Worth reading
it you want a broad overview.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/reality.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Reality is Not What it
Seems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29767627-reality-is-not-what-it-seems)**
by Carlo Rovelli

This is okay. I get very frustrated these days by books that are implicitly sexist; using
language like "when man discovered this", etc, and this book does that a fair bit. I think
I was hoping for this to answer more questions than it did; or to be a bit more detailed. I 
think I probably just misjudged the intended audience.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/brain-time.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Your Brain Is a Time
Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35187183-your-brain-is-a-time-machine)**
by Dean Buonomano

Pretty good. I haven't read much about neuroscience, and I am really mostly
confused about the physics of time, and problems like the so-called "[arrow of
time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time)", and such. So I found this
to be pretty interesting, and have some good ideas in it that I hadn't thought
about, such as different "clocks" in the body for different purposes.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> 
<img src="/images/books-2018/i-feel-you.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
**[I Feel You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36808161-i-feel-you)**
by Cris Beam

Interesting, but odd. I found this book to be worthwhile reading; in particular because it
lead me to some interesting ideas around the [ethics of AI](/posts/2018-07-25-ethics-of-AI.html).
Cris goes into weird details of empathy in use in businesses, and life. Overall, worth taking
a look at.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> 
<img src="/images/books-2018/psychadelics.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
**[How to Change Your Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36808161-i-feel-you)**
by Michael Pollan

Great. Never having taken psychadelics myself, and basically having the view that they
are a bit dangerous, this book totally changed my mind. I found it totally fascinating,
alongside Why Buddhism is True, in terms of a potential path towards enlightenment. It's
certainly interesting to learn about the history of psychadelic drugs, and think about the
connection to mindful meditation.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/nature-of-order.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Nature of Order - Book
1 - The Phenomenon of Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3131171-the-nature-of-order)**
by Christopher Alexander

Incredible. As we learned at the start, Christopher Alexander is my personal Jesus and this
set of books is essentially his bible. As a result, this is amazing reading for
me. He describes what it means for something to "have life"; he goes into detail
by way of examples, a mathematical model, and a practical, hands-on theory. He
breaks it down into what he refers to as "centers"; things that build on each
other.
</div>
</div>

<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/value.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Value of Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502362-the-value-of-everything)**
by Mariana Mazzucato

Amazing. I'm only part of the way through this book, but I love it. We saw Mariana talk
at some event a few weeks ago; and she's an amazing speaker with a incredibly ability
to talk with enthusiasm about complicated ideas.

This book is all about "value" vs "price"; and what industries should be considered "productive"
in how they contributed to the economoy. In particular it's really opened my eyes about the 
finance industry. Amazing reading. 
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> 
<img src="/images/books-2018/how-to-sit.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="text">
**[How To Sit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18342486-how-to-sit)**,
**[How To Walk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22928976-how-to-walk)**
by Thich Nhat Hanh

Amazing, and useful. I've found these two (small) books really good to read when I'm
feeling stressed or overwhelmed. They contain many little thoughts that help ground and
relax you.
</div>
</div>


### Fiction

<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/the-power.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power)**
by Naomi Alderman

Pretty good. Best read without too much knowledge of what it's about. Worth reading.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/the-martian.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian)**
by Andy Weir

Awesome. Instant classic. Great fun.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/all-the-birds.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[All the Birds in the Sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25372801-all-the-birds-in-the-sky)**
by Charlie Jane Anders

Pretty fun. A nice and simple read. I enjoyed it.
</div>
</div>

<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/fifth-season.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
The Broken Earth Series:
**[The Fifth Season](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season)**,
**[The Obselisk Gate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26228034-the-obelisk-gate)**,
**[The Stone Sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31817749-the-stone-sky)**,
by N. K. Jemisin

Incredible. The first series of books I read by N. K. Jemisin. I couldn't put
these down, and as soon as I'd finished the first one I bought the remaining
two and couldn't wait to read them.
</div>
</div>

<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/inheritance.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Inheritance Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21481566-the-inheritance-trilogy)**
by N. K. Jemisin

Really great. N. K. Jemisin is easily my favourite Sci-Fi author at the moment and I'll probably
read anything she writes. So interesting, unique, and innovative.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/dreamblood.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[The Dreamblood Duology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29775367-the-dreamblood-duology)**
by N. K. Jemisin

Really great. Quite different, really, from The Inheritance Trilogy, but still amazing.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/less.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
**[Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39927096-less)**
by Andrew Sean Greer

Not bad. I picked it up off the table in the bookshop because it had won the
Pulitzer Price, and I figured it might be good. I found it to be pretty good;
but utlimately not quite my style.
</div>
</div>


<div class="book alt">
<div class="img"> <img src="/images/books-2018/kings.jpg" /> </div>
<div class="text">
The Stormlight Archive
**[The Way of Kings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings)**,
**[Words of Radiance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332218-words-of-radiance)**,
**[Oathbringer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34002132-oathbringer)**,
by Brandon Sanderson

Awesome. I discovered Brandon after looking for something new after finishing
[The Wheel of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41526-the-wheel-of-time).
I'm really enjoying this series, and can't wait for the next one!
</div>
</div>

Hope you enjoyed this list! If you have any suggestions of books, I'd be really interested!
