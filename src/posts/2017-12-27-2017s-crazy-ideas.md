title: 2017s Crazy Ideas
author: Noon van der Silk

Given that it's the end of the year, I thought it would be nice to
generate^[It was a 'simple' matter of `jq '[.[] | select (.created_at >="2016-01-01")]' all.json>this-year.json` where I got `all.json` by combing the pages.json `curl  "https://api.github.com/repos/silky/ideas/issues?state=all&per_page=100&page=1" p1.json` with `jq -s '[.[][]]' p*.json > all.json` (jq is just _so_ easy! ...)] a
list of all the [ideas that we came up with in
2017](https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues):

idea courtesy of ryan at streat.</li>
<li><a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/272'>throw orb</a>: transforms any physical object into an object you can throw with no disastrous effects.

i.e. put this coffee in my throw-orb and throw it to me,</li>
<li><a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/271'>keyboard battleships</a>: like battleships, but set on your keyboard

<li><a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/270'>instead of a password as a string password should be the activations of a neural network; i.e. a "memory"</a>: or something.

like, your password is "that feeling you felt when you went into the water in hawaii just before you went surfing"</li>
<li><a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/269'>pass-face/face-pass</a>: an ML network that maps people's faces to their passwords, or people's password's to their face</li>
<li><a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/268'>alternative escape rooms</a>: - the "get stuck room": you need to trap yourself in a room that is well constructed and, at a surface level, very easy to exit
- "the find room": it's a room somewhere in the city, really hard to find, but once you get in, someone charges you $50
- "the haystack room": you get a million smarties and need to find the single m&m</li>
<li><a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/267'>bouncy-ball sports</a>: tennis, but with super bouncy tennis balls

<li><a href='https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/261'>data augmentation is related to this analogy-formation thing</a>: i think that people doing data-augmentation are really kind of providing evidence like "this thing is like this other thing, and not like this particular thing"

so there's a way of framing data-augmentation as a kind of re-shuffling of categories of knowledge

i.e. heres a person, and they're the same if we rotate them, and so on, so all those images of rotated people are still people

c.f. i just learned that this person is a man, that means all these other people that i didn't know about are men, and that rules out these people being men, etc ...

there's some kind of strong relation here</li>

<hr />

Unsurprisingly, given my current job, most of the ideas center around deep
learning in some capacity. At a glance, I'd say that at least half of the deep
learning ideas I've had have already been completed (in almost all cases not
by me!) so that's kinda cool. Seems like the next most popular thing to have
an idea about is fashion, which also probably won't shock you.
