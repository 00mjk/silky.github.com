This post is the second of a three-part series on the paper [An adaptive
attack on Wiesner's quantum money](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1507).

1. [Wiesner's scheme for quantum money, and why it was considered
   secure](/post/2017-01-06-forging-quantum-money-part-1.html),
2. [An attack on Wiesner's money scheme that shows it is not secure (with an
   aside into quantum bomb testing!)](#) (this post),
3. and, A modification of Wiesner's scheme that resists this attack.

Now that we are familiar with Wiesner's money, we can

# The attack by Brodutch, Nagaj, Sattath and Unruh (BNSU)
 
BNSU actually introduce two attacks, one more general than the other, but I'll
focus on the less general one; the _bomb testing_ attack, because it's more
fun.

Let's first take a brief aside into bomb-testing.

## Bomb testing

Suppose I give you 10 bombs.
