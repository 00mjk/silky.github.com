Following the whiteboard-laptop idea, today I made the 'laptop art holder'. It
looks as follows.

I used the following material:

  - 1 A3-sized plastic pocket for the front,
  - 1 A3-sized cardboard backing for the back,
  - A little bit of black electric tape to create the border, (note that the top of the thing is open, so you can change the contents),
  - 4 velcro dots attached to the laptop, and the corresponding velcro to the back of the holder itself, and,
  - 1 art.

A hobby knife comes in handy, as does a pair of scissors.

The reason I like this is because it's possible to change in whatever piece of
paper you like - of course, it needs to be of the appropriate size.
