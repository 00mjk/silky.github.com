<style type="text/css">
p {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 50px;
  background: #eaeaea;
  text-align: center;
}

div { text-align: center; }

center { margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; }
</style>

The first thing to do is to stop whatever else you are doing.

Now stand or sit in a comfortable position. <br /><br />However you wish.

Notice your breathing.

As you breathe in, <br />be aware <br />that you are <br />breathing in. <br
/><br /> As you breathe out, <br />notice that you are <br />breathing out.

**Notes on Programming**<br /><br />Many of us spend a lot of time
programming. We program at our jobs, we program at cafes, we program at home.
To _program_, in this blog, means to program in such a way that you enjoy
programming, to program in a relaxed way, with your mind awake, calm, and
clear. This is what we call _programming_, and it takes some training and
practice.
