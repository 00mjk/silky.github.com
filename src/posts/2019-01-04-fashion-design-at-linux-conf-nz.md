Excitingly, this year I'm going to [Linux Conference](https://linux.conf.au/),
and giving a talk at the [Art+Tech MiniConf](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/)!

To celebrate, I redesigned the [Van der Silk](https://vandersilk.github.io) website:

Also, very coincidentally, PAOM re-designed their website for the new year, so
it's much easier to find all my designs: [noonvandersilk on
PAOM](https://paom.com/search?type=product&q=*noonvandersilk*+tag:public).

Hope to see you there!
