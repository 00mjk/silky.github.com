Inspired by this recent paper - [Towards decolonising computational
sciences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14258.pdf) - I thought it might be a nice
idea to write down a list of privileges that I can identify I have. I'll
probably update this list as I think of them.

My list:

- White, Male, Cisgendered: I don't often feel out of place.
- Healthy: Nothing has prevented me from finding work.
- Able-bodied: Getting around is easy.
- Somewhat extroverted: Able to engage and network somewhat easily when I want to.
- No dependants: Freedom to move around and spend time as I wish.
- Financial stability from a young age: Able to take (moderate) risks.
- Supportive parent: I know I'll have a place to go.
- Supportive partner: Financial/emotional support to experiment.
- Live close to the city: Access to events, convenience.
- Good mental health: I'm able to focus when I want; am most of the time moderately calm.
- Language: I speak English natively.
- Exposed to tech from a young age: I had a computer in the house since I was
young, and was able to learn programming on my own as a result.

Surely, these things have helped me get jobs in the past. Some of them are
traits that you can improve, as wel as baseline things thare are out of my
control to some degree (i.e. mental health; certainly it can be improved, but
certainly it's not all my doing.)

I also found this: [Privilege
Checklist](https://sites.google.com/a/u.boisestate.edu/social-justice-training/about-us/our-training/privilege-checklist) from this [Social Justice Training](https://sites.google.com/a/u.boisestate.edu/social-justice-training/home) program, that is a very good starting point for building a comprehensive list. This
feels like it's probably quite a great exercise for teams to get together and
think about.

What's your list?
