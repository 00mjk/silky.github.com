## Lyrics

> now this is a story, all about how

> my life got spun, both up and down

> and i'd like to take a minute, just sit right there

> and i'll tell you how i became the prince, of the state called bell pair.

> in programming languages, born and raised,
>    on the computer, was where i spent most of my days

> typing out, compiling, building some tools,
>    and all surfing the internet looking for news

> when a couple of guys who seemed kinda fine,
>    started making trouble in polynomial time!

> they got in one little fight (BQP vs BPP) and everyone got scared,
>    someone said: we're going to build a quantum computer, so you better be prepared!
