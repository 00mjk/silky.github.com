title: You run, I run

While walking through the city yesterday I came up with a new way to try and
get some exercise. I call it "you run, I run", and the way it works is, as the
practioner of this technique, if you see any other person running or jogging
for some reason (to catch the tram, to cross the lights, etc) then you
yourself must also jog for either a block or 20 seconds or so.

I did it for my whole walk through the city, and found that I actually ended
up running most of the way. The reason is I passed several tram stops, and so
naturally there was the odd person running to catch it.

I also found it made me very aware of all the people around me - I was
constantly on the lookout to see who may be running.

I like this idea because it kind of grows exponentially - if several people
are doing it, then if just one person runs by, it will set off a chain of
runners. Then we can identify each other.

Anyway, it's fun. Maybe it will catch on!
