In "[The Oregon
Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/616875.The_Oregon_Experiment)", the authors consider the following budgeting scenario.

Suppose you're in the following situation: You have ~$2,500,000 that you'd like
to allocate to construction projects in your community.

There are many ways you can allocate this money to projects of varying sizes.
Consider the following options:

<style type="text/css">
table.budget {
margin: 10px;
background: #eaeaea;
}
table.budget th {
border: 0;
margin: 0;
border-bottom: solid 1px gray;
}
table.budget td {
border: 0;
padding: 5px;
}
table.budget td.r {
text-align: right;
}
td.m, th.m { width: 100px; }
td.r, th.r { width: 150px; }
table.budget td.m {
text-align: center;
}
table.budget tr.total td {
border-top: solid 1px gray;
}
div.tables {
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
flex-wrap: wrap;
justify-content: center;
}
div.tables div {
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
}
</style>


<div class="tables">
<div>

### Option 1 - All projects considered equally
<table class="budget">
<tr>
  <th>category</th>
  <th class="m">number of projects</th>
  <th class="r">rough total cost based on averages</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> A < $1000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> B $1000-$10,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $5,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> C $10,000-$100,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $50,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> D $100,000-$1,000,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> E > $1,000,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $2,000,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr class="total">
  <td><b>totals</b></td>
  <td class="m"> 5 </td>
  <td class="r"> ~$2,600,000 </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<div>
### Option 2 - Projects considered unequally

<table class="budget">
<tr>
  <th>category</th>
  <th class="m">number of projects</th>
  <th class="r">rough total cost based on averages</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> A < $1000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1000 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> B $1000-$10,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 100 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> C $10,000-$100,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 10 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> D $100,000-$1,000,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> E > $1,000,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> â…’ th of a project </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr class="total">
  <td><b>totals</b></td>
  <td class="m"> ~1100 </td>
  <td class="r"> $2,500,000 </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


<div>
### Option 3 - A middle ground

<table class="budget">
<tr>
  <th>category</th>
  <th class="m">number of projects</th>
  <th class="r">rough total cost based on averages</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> A < $1000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 500 </td>
  <td class="r"> $250,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> B $1000-$10,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 50 </td>
  <td class="r"> $250,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> C $10,000-$100,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 10 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> D $100,000-$1,000,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $500,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> E > $1,000,000 </td>
  <td class="m"> 1 </td>
  <td class="r"> $1,000,000 </td>
</tr>
<tr class="total">
  <td><b>totals</b></td>
  <td class="m"> ~550 </td>
  <td class="r"> $2,500,000 </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>

The main conclusion is that, for the same amount of money, we can chose to
either support lots of small projects, or few total projects.

One of the main premises of the book, is that good change is made locally, by
locals. In this way, schemes 2 and 3 are a _significant_ improvement over
Option 1.

One of the best initiatives that Victoria is doing along these lines is the
"[Pick My Project](https://pickmyproject.vic.gov.au/)" program.

However, I think it's also interesting to think about this in relation to
other areas:

- Health: Should you make one big change? Or many small ones?
- Programming: Should you write one big program? Or many little ones?
- Management: Should you set big goals from the top? Or should you empower the
  people below you to set their own goals?
