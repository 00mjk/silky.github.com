title: Deep Learning Dance Smackdown!
author: Noon van der Silk
---

For the final event of the Melbourne Creative AI meetup this year I thought
we'd run a small, fun, competition - a _deep learning dance **smackdown**_.

The event details are on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Creative-AI-Meetup/events/242805964/).

### Idea

The basic idea is, build a program that (does something like):

1. Watches a dance,
2. _and then_, Responds with a dance.

The exact format is flexible; some options would be:

1. Watch a video, learn the poses, respond with a dance,
2. Listen to audio, learn how to dance to the beat,
3. Watch a bunch of dances in joint/pose format, and then respond with dances in this same format,
4. Something else!

You may like to use:

- GANs (See
        [this](https://github.com/hwalsuklee/tensorflow-generative-model-collections) great list for a recent collection of GANs),
- Sequence models ([tensor2tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor),
 [seq2seq](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq), ...)
- Ready-made model
([human-motion-prediction](https://github.com/una-dinosauria/human-motion-prediction), ...)
- Something crazy!

The format on the night will simply be to show how your particular idea works.
It could be interactive, it could be online, it could be a presentation, it
could be embodied in an robot! I leave it to your imagination.

### Prize!

The prize on the night will be one of the Evolution of Dance T-Shirts:
