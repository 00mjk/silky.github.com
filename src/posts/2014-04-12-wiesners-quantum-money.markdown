So there has been a recent paper on a famous "quantum money" scheme - [An
adaptive attack on Wiesner's quantum money based on interaction-free
measurement](https://scirate.com/arxiv/1404.1507) - that demonstrates a method
for *simple counterfeiting*, where all this means is that given a particular
note, we can make an exact copy of it.

It's interesting and exciting because the scheme is pretty simple to
