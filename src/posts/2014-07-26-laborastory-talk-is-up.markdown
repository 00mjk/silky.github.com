title: Laborastory talk is up!
author: Noon van der Silk

The talk I gave at [The Laborastory](http://thelaborastory.com/) is online
[here](http://thelaborastory.com/stories/daniel-j-bernstein/). I chose to talk
about [djb](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html).

The planned transcript of my talk is [here](https://gist.github.com/silky/28f6aa8c080bd70282a6) 
which contains a correction by a friend that I didn't see before I gave talk.
