What is time? How do we measure a life? How many things did you get done
today? What are you working on tomorrow!? Can you come hang out on Sunday!!?

Recently, and also always, I've been thinking about how to manage a list of
todos. During an internal knowledge-sharing session [at
work](https://www.tweag.io/) I was prompted to reflect on all the different
schemes I've tried:

- Random pieces of paper
- [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad)
- [Windows sticky notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZj0WLxj-T0)
- [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)
- [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)
- [Jira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software))
- [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/) and other misc BBS software
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Vim quickfix window](https://github.com/romainl/vim-qf)
- [A terrible custom python script](https://github.com/silky/utils/tree/master/find-todo)
- [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
- Text files
- [Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org/) (I gave up almost immediately)
- Emails to myself
- A private mailing list I made up
- [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
- [Github issues](https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues)
- [Trello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trello)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- [Asana](https://asana.com/)
- [Readme files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)
- [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)
- [Bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) (for <4 minutes)
- Physical notebooks
- Fancy notebooks
- Cheap notebooks
- [Physical 'kanban' cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)
- [A whiteboard](https://github.com/silky/ideas#complete)
- My head
- Nothing
- Random pieces of paper

Right now I'm back to a whiteboard (by luck I happen to have one behind me
where I work), and 'todo' notes in code + github issues.

But that's irrelevant. Or is it?!

My friend Ruth told me something that perhaps is very obvious but was also
surprisingly calming to me: You'll die with items on your todo list. So don't
worry about it!

I think there's a few ways to think about this:

1. The optimisic view: Amazing that I am lucky enough to have things I intend
   to do and look forward to!
2. The pessimistic view: Sad that I had goals that I was never able to
   achieve!
3. The Buddhist view: Your big mistake is having desires at all!

I want to live around option (3) and (1) at the moment, but of course option
(2) is a very very strong driving force; and often necessary (for example, at
work!); the only time I was brave enough to enact option (3) at a work
setting was when [I ran my own
business](https://braneshop.com.au/posts/Braneshop-A-Living-Business-Part-1.html)!

Another interesting thing that came up as part of the work discussion was that
in some ways what you want to do depends on your mood. No doubt! So ... maybe
mood can be a parameter?!

I think, secretly, for the rest of my life, I will believe that there is a True
answer out there; an ultimate organisation scheme; the Four-Fold path to Life
Efficiency: Right Editing, Right Organisation, Right Workflow and Right
History.

But I also think that I should never think about this again. But on the other
hand, I was inspired at the talk today; so I might give task-warrior another
go.

But, you didn't come here for that! Maybe you came here for advice? So, here
it is (it's not even my advice! Gala claims it's her idea which is probably
true):

> If you can, don't even write the thing down; just do it immediately, or,
> alternatively, convince yourself you don't need to think about it now.

Maybe it's part of my personality, but this works _surprisingly_ well for me.
Especially if it's something that I'm working on with someone else; instead of
delaying my part, I can just try and make as much progress as I can
immediately, and send it back to the other person! Another way of saying this:
I can offset storing my todo list to you!

I find this idea to be quite operaitonal; I often find myself using this rule
to do something sooner rather than later.

Here's one thing I know about myself: [I can't be trusted with
lists](https://scirate.com/noonsilk). I get a
bit obsessed with organising them. So I'm trying to avoid them these days.
