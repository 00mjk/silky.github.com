title: Feaured Artist - Pablo Amaringo

Following the invention of the [laptop art holder](/posts/2014-08-10-laptop-art-holder.html) I've
realised I can now feature a particular artist on my laptop every so often.
The first of these is [Pablo Amaringo
(wiki)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Amaringo), a Peruvian artist whose
work is apparently based on the visions he saw while under the influence of
[ayahuasca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca).

His work is featured in a book - [The Ayahuasca Visions of Pablo
Amaringo](http://www.ayahuascavisions.com/index.html).

The particular work that is featured on the laptop is:

but another favourite is (note: monkey magic is hiding in this one; can you find him?):

In particular I like just how much detail there is in each painting, and
everywhere you look you can find something new, if you stare at it for a few
moments. ([This](https://soundcloud.com/pnkslm/goat-mixtape-mastered) is a
pretty good track to listen to while looking at these paintings, by the way.)

It turns out it's possible to [buy
prints](http://ayahuasca_visions.imagekind.com/store/) (though seemingly not
of the paintings I've linked to, which I found by an image search.)
