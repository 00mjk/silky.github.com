<div>
<p>In my job I’m almost entirely surrounded by men.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="http://silverpond.com.au">Silverpond</a>. It’s definitely the best place I’ve ever worked, but there’s one area that we’re actively trying to improve: recruiting women into roles as software engineers and machine learning engineers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In this post I’ll cover some ideas I’ve had along these lines.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="the-recruiting-side">The Recruiting Side</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>When I’ve been involved in recruiting people, in recent history, it’s tended to be almost entirely by word of mouth. My process is:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><div>
I find out there’s a job available,
</div></li>
<li><div>
I think about the people I know who might be good,
</div></li>
<li><div>
I approach them.
</div></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<p>This actually works very well, but only because I tend to go to a lot of events, and I meet a lot of people. The one key problem with this approach is: I mostly end up recommending men.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I think that the reason for this can be somewhat explain by various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a> (notably, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism">Ingroup bias</a>”), and so I’ve been thinking about how to address it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I was pointed at the few articles along these lines, and I’ll summarise them here:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong><a href="http://malechampionsofchange.com/take-practical-action/avoiding-the-merit-trap/">Avoiding the ‘merit trap’</a></strong> - Chief Executive Women and Male Champions of Change</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
<strong>Summary</strong>: “Merit-based” hiring is correlated with under-representation for diverse teams.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Thoughts:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
Be aware that any definition of “merit” is somewhat subjective and current-circumstances dependant.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Deciding which qualities are meritable isn’t particularly easy.
</div></li>
<li><div>
This might mean that “puzzle”-based hiring; i.e. “complete this puzzle which when solved gives an email address that you can email for a job” is potentially not a good approach.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
<li><div>
Actions:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
As much as you can, don’t pre-suppose a list of skills and qualities, because your selection is biased to the intersection of skills that your current team has, or that you’ve seen before.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Allow the candidates to express their own individuality in the interviewing process.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Prefer the person that adds something new to the team.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong><a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/beginning-with-ourselves/">Beginning with Ourselves</a></strong> - Airbnb</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
<strong>Summary</strong>: Airbnb was didn’t have many women in their data science team; they adjusted their interview process and grew the community, both of which had an impact.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Thoughts:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
Your interview process can be biased, and it’s probably hard to figure out when that is. If someone tells you, take it seriously.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
<li><div>
Actions:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
Build the community you want to see.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Make your interview process friendly and welcoming to all.
</div></li>
<li><div>
If possible, have a balance of male/female involvement in the interview.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
<strong>Summary</strong>: If you want to not be biased towards a certain gender, then just keep the gender hidden until they’re employed!
</div></li>
<li><div>
Thoughts:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
It’s interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. It wouldn’t help for internal promotions, say. But maybe it’s a useful hack to bootstrap the process.
</div></li>
<li><div>
It’s not practical for me at Silverpond.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
<li><div>
Actions:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
When thinking about a candidate, and making some subjective assesment, think if you would make this same assesment if the gender of the candidate was unknown or switched.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="http://malechampionsofchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/31.-2011-MCC-report.pdf">Our experiences in elevating the representation of women in leadership</a></strong> - Male Champions of Change</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
<strong>Summary</strong>: Diversity in leadership can be achived by small concrete steps: getting the CEO interested, setting up metrics, building communities and support networks, and reporting on growth and successes achieved as a result of these actions.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Thoughts:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
This is a very “corporate” article, but contains some good points.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
<li><div>
Actions:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
Convince or demonstrate to the people in charge of hiring that they should become very interested in diversifying the team; without this you will struggle.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Set up mechanisms to track progress numerically.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Set quantitive targets.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Build and support the community you want to see.
</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<hr />
</div>
<div>
<p>Concretely, what I’m going to do in this regard — getting more diverse applicants into the top of our “hiring funnel” — is:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><div>
Network with a more diverse group; head to events I’ve not been to before,
</div></li>
<li><div>
Improve the messaging on our website around hiring, and write down some statistics that we can start tracking,
</div></li>
<li><div>
Build and support the community.
</div></li>
<li><div>
When thinking about a candidate, and making some subjective assesment, think if I would make this same assesment if the gender of the candidate was unknown or switched.
</div></li>
<li><div>
Don’t pre-suppose an overly-specific list of skills and qualities.
</div></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<p>and during the interview process, I think the following ideas are useful to keep in mind:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><div>
Make sure everyone has an opportunity to feel comfortable,
</div></li>
<li><div>
Allow the candidates to express their own individuality,
</div></li>
<li><div>
Does this person add something new to the team?
</div></li>
<li><div>
Is the job a <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/16/hiring---opportunity/">cool opportunity</a> for this person?
</div></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is kind of a Part-1 of my thoughts on this topic. I’ve had this post sitting in <em>drafts</em> for a while, so I thought I’d publish it. I expressed some related ideas in our <a href="http://silverpond.com.au/2017/03/27/silverponds-diversity-report.html">blog</a>. Let’s see how it progresses over the next few months.</p>

<!--
    - Encouragement
    - Internal/Exerternal actions
    - community building/support
    - differing interests? maybe don't expect pages of github repos
    - passion vs side projects ...
    - changing requirements on men too?
    - ?
