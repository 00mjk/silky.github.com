<p>Anyone who has used Mathematica<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for more than 5 minutes probably knows that the undo functionality will leave you feeling pretty sad. You can very quickly find yourself having deleted something that you wanted to keep, and having Control-Z completely ignore your requests to go back in time.</p>
<p>I was complaining about this on Google+ a while back when I realised that there is a very easy solution - Autosave copies of your Mathematica files somehow, and then rollback to a different version if you want one!</p>
<p>“Brilliant”, I thought, I’ll just write a Mathematica plugin to do this! Ah, but infact it turns out I can be even lazier than that, and get this functionality entirely outside of Mathematica, and I can use Haskell and git in the process (you aren’t really having fun until you use Haskell to solve a minor inconvenience.)</p>
<p>So I happened to have the following programs installed, which are used to monitor a folder for file changes and to run actions upon file changes,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sordina/commando">Commando</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sordina/conscript">Conscript</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So step (1) is to install these. Step (2) is to install <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> (or some other source control system, it doesn’t matter which).</p>
<p>Step (3) is to now edit all your Mathematica files in some special directory; I’ve chosen <code>~/mathematica_working</code>. So I’ve turned this into a git repository with <code>git init</code>, and then I have the following two scripts in the folder:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code># start.sh
commando -c echo | grep --line-buffered '.nb' | conscript ./autosave.sh</code></pre>
<pre class="shell"><code># start.sh
git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;Auto-save.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>and every time I start working on some Mathematica files, I run <code>./start</code>. This begins tracking changes.</p>
<p>Now, every time I save a document in Mathematica, this setup auto-commits it. The output in this terminal looks something like this, depending on what you change:</p>
<pre><code>[master eded096] Auto-save.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)</code></pre>
<p>So now I have a nice history of changes to Mathematica files. If I accidentally delete a big chunk of code, or just want to see what I used to have, I can use all the machinery that the source-control system makes available to me! And because the Mathematica files are in a plaintext format, it’s not impossible to review the diffs meaningfully! (It’s not exactly amazingly-pleasant though.)</p>
