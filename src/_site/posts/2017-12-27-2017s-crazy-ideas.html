<p>Unsurprisingly, given my current job, most of the ideas center around deep learning in some capacity. At a glance, I’d say that at least half of the deep learning ideas I’ve had have already been completed (in almost all cases not by me!) so that’s kinda cool. Seems like the next most popular thing to have an idea about is fashion, which also probably won’t shock you.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/silky/ideas/issues/14">programmers keyboard</a>: there are many ideas like this, but i’m not sure which one i like best. a custom key layout? an actual physical keyboard? a supplemental keyboard to the typical one? a modal keyboard? one idea is to add a new row of keys. This new row would feature specific keys for characters such as: ! ? * &lt; &gt; ( ) { } . &quot; : + &amp; | . This list could possible be configured for different languages, as some wouldn’t require those characters, and may want different ones (for example Python, or some form of assembly). But at least it may save us from constantly pressing shift, and it may be interesting to see if it can lead to other possible benefits; i.e. what other buttons could be implemented and considered. It may be interesting to consider a ‘build’ button, or attach some macros to ‘programmable’ buttons. It is already known that <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">programmable keyboards</a> exist, so maybe they are the answer; but they are very expensive. maybe this can all be solved by vim configurations, though (as with many of lifes problems).
